## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly

### Screenshot

I will include screenshots in my GitHub repository.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project was a pretty huge one for me. This was a difficult layout for me to figure out, and this was the first time I've ever worked with form validation. I didn't really know what I was getting into, but I was excited to learn these new concepts. I had to do a lot of research, but I learned how to do email validation using JavaScript. It took me multiple tries to get the JavaScript working like I wanted it to. I did eventually watch a YouTube video of someone making this project and I copied their code into mine, but I commented it out after I understood the gist of what they did so I could alter my attempt to make it work. Theirs was more organized and clean though so I'd like to start working more like them.

I had some difficulty with certain methods that I looked up, and I didn't know why. I couldn't use reset() or reload() to work for me for some reason. I also tried to change the color of the input field's border when it was focused on but the CSS just seemed to ignore everything I tried to do to that. I eventually just gave up on those.

I added a thank you message after the user enters a valid email, just so it was more visible that it had worked.

### Continued development

I'm going to continue working on projects that use JavaScript, especially ones that require form validation. I know that's going to be an important concept for me in the future so I want to get a really solid grasp on it. I'd like to work more on writing functions into my code, to keep it cleaner.

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::placeholder) - This taught me how to style my placeholder text.
- [Resource 2](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform-function/scaleX) - This taught me how to use scaleX on my submit button when it's hovered over.
- [Resource 3](https://www.w3resource.com/javascript/form/email-validation.php) - This gave me the expression that I used for my email validation.
- [Resource 4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=In0nB0ABaUk) - I watched this video for a basic understanding of form validation in JavaScript.
- [Resource 5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09wN4Rp9EGk) - I watched this to see how they wrote their JavaScript and took inspiration from it.
